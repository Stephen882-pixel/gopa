# flag-icons

These flags are part of the [flag-icons][1] library

If you are interested in using the library you could install it

    user@linux:~/apps/spa> npm install flag-icons

If you are interested in adding only one flag:

    user@linux:~> wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lipis/flag-icons@7.3.2/flags/4x3/bi.svg

If you navigate to [cdn.jsdelivr.net][2] you can get the latest stable version that you can use when getting the flags only.
